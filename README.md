# ES2C6 Self Balancing Robot Project

*A project that aims to design, build and test a self-balancing robot from scratch*

## About the Project

This project was undertaken in mid-2019 with the initial open-ended brief to create a self-balancing robot that can stand for around 10 seconds. It was developed using an Arduino Uno that was programmed with feedback loop to enable it to stand. 

Ultimately, the project did okay. Due to the design, it was imbalanced (i.e. too front heavy) which made it increasingly harder to tune the PID constants. Further details on the project are in an uploaded PDF.

## Usage

You will require an Ardunio with the correct peripherals. A list of parts can be found within the uploaded document. You will also require the [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software)
